## Welcome to Flower Data Analysis 

Today, I'm going to visualize a unique dataset of bee-friendly flowers with Plotly.


## Dataset Overview 

The dataset features flowers known for attracting bees. I will examine attributes like bloom color, season, and height.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(plotly)
library(dplyr)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Sample flower dataset
flower_data <- data.frame(
  Flower = c("Lavender", "Sunflower", "Bluebell", "Poppy", "Daisy"),
  Bloom_Color = c("Purple", "Yellow", "Blue", "Red", "White"),
  Bloom_Season = c("Summer", "Summer", "Spring", "Spring", "Summer"),
  Height_cm = c(50, 180, 30, 45, 20)
)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Create the Plotly bar chart
flower_plot <- plot_ly(
  flower_data,    
  x = ~Flower,    
  y = ~Height_cm,    
  type = 'bar',    
  color = ~Bloom_Color,   
  colors = c("purple", "gold", "cornflowerblue", "salmon", "lightcoral"), # Flower-inspired colors   
  text = ~paste("Season: ", Bloom_Season),   
  hoverinfo = 'text' 
) %>%   
layout(     
  title = "Flower Heights by Bloom Color",     
  title = list(size = 24, color = "indigo"),     
  xaxis = list(title = "Flower"), # Add title to x-axis
  yaxis = list(title = "Height (cm)") # Add title to y-axis
)

# Display the plot
flower_plot
```

## Thank You
